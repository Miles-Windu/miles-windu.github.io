            <p>Placeholder for content: Now this is a story all about how
                    My life got flipped turned upside down
                    And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
                    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air</p>
            <p>In West Philadelphia born and raised
                    On the playground is where I spent most of my days
                    Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
                    And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
                    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                    And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"</p> 
            <p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                    The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
                    If anything I could say that this cab was rare
                    But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to Bel-Air!"
             </p> 
            <p>I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
                And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
                Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
                To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
